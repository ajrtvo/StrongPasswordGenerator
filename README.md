# Strong Password Generator and Secured Credential Manager
A Python application that generates strong password combinations and securely stores them in an encrypted file. With this tool, you can create complex, unique passwords for your accounts, and access them when needed. This application is designed to prioritize security and ease of use. Say goodbye to weak passwords and the hassle of remembering them. 

# Features
- Strong Password Generator: Create complex and secure passwords based on user custom settings.<br>
- Credential Manager: Store and manage passwords associated with your accounts securely.<br>
- Command-line Interface: User-friendly CLI for easy interaction.<br>

# Getting Started
# First Run
1. Launch the Application: Double-click SecuredCredentialManager.exe to run the application.
2. Generate a New Encryption File: During the first run, the application will prompt you to generate a new encryption file. This file is essential for securing your credentials. 
3. Securing the Eryption File: It's crucial to keep your encryption file in a secure location. This file is your key to accessing your stored credentials. Without it, your data is unreadable.
   
# Subsequent Runs
On subsequent runs of the application, you have two options:
1. Use the Existing Encryption File: You can opt to use the encryption file you generated during the first run. This will enable you to access your stored credentials immediately.
2. Create a New Encryption File: If you want to change your encryption key or start fresh, you can create a new encryption file. However, please note that doing so will clear all stored credentials. This is a security measure to prevent attackers from gaining access to your data. Just delete or move the existing/current encryption file.

# Managing Credentials
Once you've set up your encryption file, you can manage your credentials with ease: 
1. Add New Credential: Use the application to add new credentials for your accounts, services, or websites.
2. Retrieve Stored Credentials: Easily access your stored credentials when required.
3. Delete Credential File: Remove all stored credentials when needed.
